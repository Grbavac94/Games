# Games
While I was learning I came with an ideal for my own Snake.
I used turtle time and random to import so I could write this code.
Whole code is in python with little problems but still it works, not the way I expected but its still good for beggining
Im interested in new desings for old school games even to make remake of the same game but in much better resolution :D
If you want to try it, go try it.
